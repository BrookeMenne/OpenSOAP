# OpenSOAP
The Spacecraft Operations Analysis Package provides some tools for performing system-level analyses of spacecraft mission operations. It could be useful for investigating power and data budgets, and playing with different ConOps designs. 

## Installation
See the installation guide included in the [docs package](docs/src/install.md).

## Documentation
Documentation is included in the [docs folder](docs/). 

## Usage
Wait until I improve the docs, I guess! Or just get [`test/plot.jl`](test/plot.jl) to run.
